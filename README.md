## DISCLAIMER

**_Please, please, please be careful. I'm pretty sure it shouldn't eat up your collection, but it might. If your are testing booksing, please copy your files into the import dir. Do not move them until you feel comfortable with booksing._**

## Features
- Easy-to-use
- List view
- Light weight, blazing fast, static html web interface, that even works on the terrible kindle browser
- Automatic deletion of duplicates and unparsable epubs
- Automatic sorting of books based on Author
- See what books have been downloaded
- If you have an authenticating proxy booksing can determine the username from a header, and the admin user will be able to grant users access.

## Tips
- For large collections, it is perfectly acceptable to place the ebooks themselves on an external USB drive, but you should place the database dir on a faster (preferable SSD) disk.
- The database file is regular sqlite, so you can just copy and paste it to make a backup, and use sqlite3 cli to explore the database
- Booksing does not try to create directories to place its sqlite database, or any of the other directories, please create them yourself.
- Regular search is kind of fuzzy thanks the sqlite's full text search. You can also use advanced queries like:
  - `author:Mark Twain, title:the adventures of tom sawyer`
  - `author:mark twain`

## Example first run

$ mkdir booksing booksing/failed booksing/import booksing/db 
$ cd booksing

$ tar xzf booksing*
$ mkdir books db failed import
$ ./booksing &
$ mv ~/library/*.epub import/
# visit localhost:7132 to see the books in the interface
```
